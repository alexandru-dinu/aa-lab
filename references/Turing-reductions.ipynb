    "For example, if we know how to solve the satisfiability problem (SAT), then we can solve the k-Vertex Cover problem. The only thing we have to do is to convert the input from the k-Vertex Cover problem, `G = (V, E), k`, to a boolean formula `Ï†`.\n",

    "The transformation `T` takes as an input an instance for problem A, in<sub>A</sub> and outputs an input for problem B, in<sub>B</sub>: T(in<sub>A</sub>) = in<sub>B</sub>. The transformation must be decidable (it should only convert inputs and not perform any other computation that itself is not decidable).\n",

    "The above transformation is not decidable because it performs a computation that is not decidable (asks whether M halts, and that is the halting problem).\n",
